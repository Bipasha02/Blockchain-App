# Blockchain-App

Blockchain is a decentralized technology that uses smart contracts to execute transactions. These smart contracts define the semantics of a web 3.0 application.

The project "Modern Web 3.0 Blockchain App" aims to develop a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages the principles of Web 3.0 and blockchain technology. Web 3.0 refers to the next evolution of the internet, where decentralized, trustless, and transparent applications are built on blockchain networks. This project combines the power of modern web development with blockchain to create a more secure, decentralized, and user-centric application.
